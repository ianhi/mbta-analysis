    "# 77 Travel Times before and after bus lane\n",
    "In november of 2021 bus lanes were added to Mass Ave between Dudley Street and Alewife Brook Parkway (see https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Transportation/regionalplanning/masstransit/buspriority). This notebook will compare bus travel times before and after their implementation. Unfortunately this all takes place in the backdrop of covid which undoubtedbly has had a large effect on bus ridership and traffic on the roads. This notebook will make some plots and include some attempts a controls. However, take care to not draw casual conclusions from the contents of this notebook, without more rigorous statistical analysis we can't claim anything firm.\n",
